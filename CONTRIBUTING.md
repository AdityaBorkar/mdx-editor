# Contributing to Lexical MDX

First things first, if you're doing something in the space, [contact me over email](https://github.com/petyosi/). 
The project is still in its infancy, and I would love to get additional perspective.

The project is a lerna monorepo with PNPM, using conventional commits for versioning.

Bundling is done with Vite, and tests are using Vitest.

To test a scenario in the browser, `pnpm start` the project in `packages/playground` - it uses [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/).
